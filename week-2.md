# Week 2

## Math overview

### Topics
- Complexity
	- Proof by Inductions
		- weak  - assumes that n-1 is true, and we prove the formula hole for n 
		- strong - not so clear, we assume it is true till m, where m < n
- Recursion

#### Day 1
- Why do computers take time do anything 
- Why do we care that it actually takes time
- Now that we know we care about why computers take time, we need a way of measuring how long they take, how do we measure them
- Big-Oh notation #important #understand
- amortized complexity

#### Todo
[] Example Program to demonstrate what is growth rate, ideally would like to have graphs. 
1. linear time 
2. Quadratic
3. exponential time
Idea to communicate, how we use number of times something is called as a proxy for time
