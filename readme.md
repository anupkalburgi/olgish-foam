## Algorithms Study Plan
Duration: **August 3rd 2020 to December 14th 2020**

#### Books:	
- [Algorithm Design Manual from Skiena](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-84800-070-4)
- Has implementation and explanations [Data Structures and Algorithms with Python](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-13072-9)
	- Text Book Website https://kentdlee.github.io/CS2Plus/build/html/index.html 
- [Data Structures Explained](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/)


##### Tools
- Install wing IDE
- Visualize Code Execution - Very helpful when you have code and need to see how value of variables change and debug the code - http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit


All coding will be in python. 
General Guide: 
1. Don't keep exploring your self if you are stuck ask the questions
2. don't write code, if you don't understand the problem. Code is a way of telling something to a computer what todo. Before you can do that you have to know what you need to do 
3. Write code and commit code and ask for feedback as soon as you can
	
### [[[Week_1]]] - Aug 3 -Aug 7th

1. Python programming 101
2. Object Oriented Programming Concepts
3. Will setup the computer so that we can run examples fine

### [[Week_2]] - Aug 3 -Aug 7th
#### We will learn
1. Understand why computer take time to run a piece of code
2. How much time does a computer take, and can we get a intution about how long a algorithm/computer program is going to take
3. And can we prove that it is not going to take longer than that. - We will see some easy methods to do that.
